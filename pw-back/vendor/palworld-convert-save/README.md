# palworld-save-tools
Tools for converting Palworld .sav files to JSON and back.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tool has changed how the JSON files are formatted starting with v0.9.
> You cannot load JSON files created by older versions of the tool, and other tools that depend on the JSON output of `palworld-save-tools` will break.
> In exchange, you will no longer need `uesave-rs`, the tool runs faster, and doesn't use as much RAM.

> [!CAUTION]
> Any versions older than v0.4 will create corrupt `Level.sav` files when converting from JSON to SAV. Please make sure to update to avoid data corruption.

This tool currently supports additional parsing of the following data not handled by `uesave` or other non-Palworld aware Unreal save editors:

1. `Level.sav`:`GroupSaveDataMap`
    - Groups such as in-game organizations and guilds
1. `Level.sav`:`CharacterSaveParameterMap`
    - Characters such as players and pals
1. `Level.sav`: `MapObjectSaveData.MapObjectSaveData.Model`
1. `Level.sav`: `ItemContainerSaveData`
1. `Level.sav`: `CharacterContainerSaveData`
1. `Level.sav`: `DynamicItemSaveData`
1. `Level.sav`: `FoliageGridSaveDataMap`
1. `Level.sav`: `BaseCampSaveData`

Some fields that are not currently parsed:

1. `Level.sav`: `BaseCampSaveData.Value.ModuleMap`
1. `Level.sav`: `WorkSaveData.WorkSaveData`
1. `Level.sav`: `WorkSaveData.WorkSaveData.WorkAssignMap`
1. `Level.sav`: `MapObjectSaveData.MapObjectSaveData.ConcreteModel`

## Converting co-op saves to dedicated server saves

Please follow the instructions provided over at https://github.com/xNul/palworld-host-save-fix

## Instructions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Converting `Level.sav` files to JSON will result in very large files, and may require significant amounts of RAM to process. Use a modern text editor such as Visual Studio Code or a Jetbrains IDE to open these files.

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.9 or newer.
    - Windows users: You can install [Python 3.12 from the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NCVDN91XZQP) or from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

### Windows GUI steps

1. Download the latest release from [https://github.com/cheahjs/palworld-save-tools/releases/latest].
1. Unzip the file into a folder.
1. Drag and drop your `.sav` file (for Steam on Windows, these are located at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\<SteamID>\<SaveID>`) onto `convert.cmd` to convert the file into JSON.
1. To convert the `.sav.json` file back into a `.sav` file, drag and drop your `.sav.json` file onto `convert.cmd`.

> [!NOTE]
> In the event that the `convert.cmd` fails to function correctly, try to disable Python's app execution aliases ("Manage app execution aliases"), or failing that, please use the [Terminal](#terminal) instructions below

### Terminal

1. Download the latest release from [https://github.com/cheahjs/palworld-save-tools/releases/latest].
1. Unzip the file into a folder.
1. Open a terminal in the folder you just unzipped.
1. Depending on how Python is installed, the next steps should use either `python`, `python3`, or `py`.
1. Run `python convert.py <path to .sav file>` to convert the `.sav` file to a `.sav.json` file.
1. Run `python convert.py <path to .json file>` to convert the `.sav.json` file to a `.sav` file.

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows, you can drag and drop the `convert.py` file and the `.sav`/`.sav.json` file to avoid typing out the path.

Additional command line arguments:

1. `--to-json`: Force SAV to JSON conversion regardless of file extension
1. `--from-json`: Force JSON to SAV conversion regardless of file extension
1. `--output`: Override the default output path
1. `--minify-json`: Minify output JSON to help speed up processing by other tools consuming JSON
